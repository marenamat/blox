# BloX

BloX is a framework for controlling a hardware box programatically. The backend
supplies the frontend with a list of configured devices on its side, whereas
the frontend allows the user to define device actions by Blockly primitives.

As this framework is to be used primarily locally, there is no security
measurement anywhere, yet it should be added in some future versions.

This project is under construction, unstable and incomplete.
